# How to play the game:

press z to take order from customer
press c to pick up ingredients
press x to serve the order when you are ready



# Game Logic update from Arthas:

Making draw_text more modular

Available hard_code orders are in catcoffee.hpp, an order is generated randomly(chosen from the existing list) for each custmoer.

New class called Customer inside PlayMode.hpp for George(if you want add more attributes like waiting time)

Read my code for more details. (I worked from 9 to 2)
